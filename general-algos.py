*Binary search tree:
    -insert an item to its right position in the tree to stay sorted.
    -for every node, the nodes on the left are smaller, and the nodes on the right are larger.
*Balanced binary search trees: red-black trees, AVL-trees.
*Trees: B-trees, Heaps, Splay trees

*Inverted index: a hash that maps words to places where they appear. (used in search engines)

*Fourier transform: given a smoothie, the Fourier transform will tell you the ingredients in the smoothie.

*Parallel Programming: 
    -Overhead of managing the parallelism (dividing, sending, and merging the data) 
    -Load balancing: each core get an equal work to evenly distribute the work

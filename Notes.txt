#Chapter 4 (Quicksort):
* Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that:
    -O(nlogn) average case
    -O(n^2) worst case
    -But it is faster than mergesort, which is O(nlogn), as It has smaller constant factor than mergesort.
    -Faster in practice than mergesort, as it hits the average case way more than the worst case.
    -In Quicksort, the best case is also the average case.

* If you always choose a random element in the array as the pivot (is it the middle element?)

"""
Usage:
    *find the shortest path for weighted edges (the smallest total weight)

Steps:
    1-Find the cheapest node.
    2-Update the path to neighbors with a cheaper cost (if possible)
    3-Repeat until you've done this for every node in the graph.
    4-Calculate the final path.

Notes:
    *Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm only works with directed acyclic graphs, called DAGs for short.
    *You can't Dijkstra's algorithm with negative-weight edges.
    *Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest-path in a graph that has negative-weight edges.

Dividing the algorithm into functions will:
    1- Make it more readable
    2- avoid mistakes
    3- give you overview
    4- abstract, so it is easier to remember

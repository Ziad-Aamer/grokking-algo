Dynamic programming:
    *solving subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem.

    *Handling items that depend on each other:
        Dynamic programming is powerful because it can solve
        subproblems and use those answers to solve the big problem. Dynamic
        programming only works when each subproblem is discrete—when it
        doesn’t depend on other subproblems.

    *DP is useful when you are trying to optimize something given a constraint.
        E.g.: In the knapsack problem, you are maximizing what you can steal given a constrained size of knapsack.

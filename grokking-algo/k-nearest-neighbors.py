KNN is used for classification and regression, and involves looking at the k-nearest neighbours.

    -Classification = categorization into groups.
    -Regresion = predicting (like predicting a fruit is Orange or Grapefruit 
        based on its features matching with previous samples)

*We can use the ecludian distance to discover how much 2 items are close.
        
*Feature extraction means converting an item (like a fruit or user) into a list of numbers (size or color of a fruit) 
    that can be compared.
*Not any features will work, we have to pick good features for a successful KNN.

*OCR (Optical character recognition) a photo to text

*Spam filters use another simple algorithm called the Naive Bayes classifier.
